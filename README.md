This repository contains notebooks from the blog titled "[Recognizing Geometric Shapes in 2-D Space Using Machine Learning](https://www.cctech.co.in/blog/recognizing-geometric-shapes-in-2d-space-using-machine-learning)"

<ul> There are two notebooks:
<li> <b> Conic_Shapes_Generator.ipynb </b> - This notebook contains code to generate the dataset of conic curves.
<li> <b> Conic_Shapes_Training.ipynb  </b> - This notebook contains code for training a neural network classifier that can classify the conic shapes.
</ul>
